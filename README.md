# TripleDouble
 A web app that lets you build two starting lineups—modern or all-time—and simulate a series between them. Whether it’s the 2016 Warriors vs the 2001 Lakers, or your own custom dream teams, this app answers the ultimate basketball "what if" question.

- Sketch wireframes or use tools like Figma
